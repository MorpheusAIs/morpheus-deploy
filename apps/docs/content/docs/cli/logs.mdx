# Only application logs
morpheus logs --service agent

# Only database logs
morpheus logs --service postgres
```

## Log Levels

Logs are color-coded by level:

- **ERROR** - Red
- **WARN** - Yellow
- **INFO** - Default
- **DEBUG** - Gray (only with --verbose)

## Exiting

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop following logs.

## Pipe to File

Save logs to a file:

```bash
morpheus logs --no-follow > deployment.log
```

## JSON Output

For programmatic processing:

```bash
morpheus logs --json | jq '.message'
```
