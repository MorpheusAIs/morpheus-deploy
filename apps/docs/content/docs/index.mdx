# Welcome to Morpheus Deploy

Morpheus is a developer-first CLI and API that brings the simplicity of Vercel deployments to decentralized infrastructure. Deploy AI agents, MCP servers, and web applications to Akash Network with a single command.

```bash
npx morpheus-deploy init
npx morpheus-deploy deploy
```

## Why Morpheus?

Modern AI agents need **sovereign infrastructure**—compute that can't be shut down, censored, or rate-limited. Morpheus solves three critical problems:

| Problem               | Traditional Cloud                 | Morpheus Solution               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Cloud Bottleneck**  | Centralized APIs with rate limits | Decentralized Akash compute     |
| **DX Gap**            | Complex Kubernetes manifests      | One-command deployment          |
| **Economic Friction** | Credit cards, KYC, invoices       | Crypto-native funding with USDC |

## Key Features

- **One-Command Deploy** - From code to running container in under 60 seconds
- **Smart Wallet Identity** - Passkey-based authentication, no seed phrases
- **Cross-Chain Funding** - Pay with USDC on Base, deploy on Akash
- **Durable Execution** - Built-in PostgreSQL for workflow state persistence
- **Real-Time Logs** - WebSocket-based log streaming
- **Auto Top-Up** - Gas Station monitors escrow and refills automatically
- **Multi-Template Support** - AI agents, MCP servers, websites, custom deployments
